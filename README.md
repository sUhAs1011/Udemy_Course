### Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing

This code implements the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to solve the Lunar Lander problem in OpenAI Gym. The objective is to train an agent to land a spacecraft safely between the flags.

A neural network is utilized as a function approximator for estimating Q-values. The agent stores experiences from previous interactions with the environment in a replay memory, enabling it to learn from past actions and outcomes. The Q-values are updated iteratively using the Bellman equation to optimize the agent's decision-making.

The training process focuses on enabling the agent to develop policies for stable and successful landings. Finally, the performance of the trained agent is visualized, showcasing its ability to land effectively and safely within the designated area.
