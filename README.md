1."Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing", is an implementation of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm for solving the Lunar Lander problem in OpenAI Gym environments, where we are using Q-Learning for training the agent for proper landing between the flags. Here we are create a neural network and the agent stores all the previous values and based on these past values the agent is trained and then the Q-values are updated using the bellaman equation and finally the the landing is visualized basically indicating the performance of the agent
